## Repository branches

**build**

The latest version of the patched dmenu.

It contains all of my chosen patches already merged into the base code of the latest tagged dmenu version.

There are other branches merged into this one: **misc** and **distribution**

**\*-patch**

There is a branch for each patch that will be applied to my dmenu.
This branch uses the name of the patch suffixed with `-patch`.

For example, the _border_ patch has its own branch called __border-patch__.

These branches contain the base original code plus the patch already applied.

The idea is to merge all those _patch_ branches into the **build** one to cook the customized dmenu.

**distribution**

This branch contains an Archlinux build system PKGBUILD and a shell script to help building a _dmenu_ package.

**misc**

Basically, it contains a modified README file.
